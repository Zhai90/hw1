          Dad's always tired mentally and doesn't say much throughout the story.
          The moment in which he says the most is when he's either having a
          mental breakdown or mad at absolutely everything. In the story, his
          speech is usually either full of furiousness, madness, regret, or
          sometimes, just kindness, although that last one only appears very
          late into the story.

          He suffers a lot in the early and middle part of the story, which is
          inevitable. It is extremely easy to notice his pain, suffering,
          disgrace, misery and grief in those periods of the story, although
          later in the story, he has obviously changed, and by a lot, almost
          completely reversing his attitude.

          He always tried to move on with life but fails, tries to let everyone
          know that he really misses Rose, to a point that the people around him
          don't really want to talk to him anymore, but it is really obvious
          that he is always trying his best.

          He doesn't really do much, he drinks, sleeps, sometimes brings Jamie
          to school early in the story, and then later on a bit later in the
          story, he treats his son and daughter much better than before, brings
          them to school often, accepts the facts and that a lot of things are
          going to be different, unavoidbly.

          He always wears some casual clothes at home everyone would wear, but
          just a bit dirtier than usual, also a bit worn out too and wears
          slippers usually. His looks drastically improves as his attitude and
          behaviour towards others also improves later on in the story.
